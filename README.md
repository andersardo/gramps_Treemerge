# Gramps_Treemerge
A Gramps plugin to match (detect overlap) and merge data from 2 trees

# DESIGN

The implementation borrows a lot from Gramps plugins as GraphView and 'Find Possible Duplicate People'.

  * Generate a text-representation of a person (possibly including parents) with names, dates, places
      and index that in a free-text database
  * Use a person text-representation as a query to the free-text database
  * Test the top X results more detailed for a possible match
  * Use a machine-learning tool like SVM or ensemble classification to categorise matches.
    They are machine-learning tools that you
    train to recognize and group objects (feature vectors) into categories.
    In this case feature vectors are comparisons between persons and categories are 'match' and 'no match'.
    A feature vector consists of various aspect like name similarity, event similarity, see below.
    The classification give a probability (shown as 'Rating' in the list of matches) that a match is an exact match.\
    **[SVM](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html)** uses only the features described below\
    **[Ensemble](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#stacking)** combines a number of different
    categorizersd for better accuracy

The above design avoids the need to compare all persons to all other persons thus cutting the algorithm complexity from
n-squared to k * n where n is the number of persons in the database and k is an implementation dependent constant.

Matches can be grouped in 3 categories 'certain match', 'maybe', 'certain nomatch' where only 'maybe'
needs to be inspected manually.

A 'certain match' would be where a calculated probability is above 95 % of being an exact match. 

Categorisation is based on 'feature vectors' where features usually range from -1 (complete miss-match) to
1 (complete match). Features used are:
  * _score_, How good a hit from the free-text database is
  * _personSim_, Similarity of persons based on name and event-date comparisons
  * _familySim_, Mean of similarity for father and mother
  * _birthSim_, Similarity of birth-date and birth-place
  * _birthYearSim_, Birth years equal
  * _deathSim_, Similarity of death-date and death-place
  * _deathYearSim_, Death years equal
  * _firstNameSim_, Given name equality
  * _firstNameStrSim_, String similarity of all given names sorted and concatenated in a string
  * _lastNameSim_, Surname name equality
  * _compareLifeSpans_, Lifespans compatible

## TODO/IDEAS

* Use full Graphview with the 2 matched persons as center-persons in order to inspect the family-trees around a match

* Support family-matching and merging

## QUESTIONS

- Is it possible to keep enough information to be able undo a merge in case there is an error discovered later? Even
  if you shutdown Gramps?

# USE
**Warning: Data Corruption Risk**

Mass changes mean more potential for mangling the data. Back up (using Gramps XML backup) your current
tree **BEFORE** using this tool to merge.
If something goes wrong, you will then have a way to go back and start over.

**Hint - speed improvement**

If you add a tag like "Imp%Y%m%d%H%M%S" on import the plugin will make an effort just to match those persons imported last,
in order to speed up things. Otherwise all persons will be matched.

## Start
Start **Treemerge** from the tools menu ('Family Tree Processing' -> 'Merge 2 trees by matching persons')

## Matching
Select matching algoritm - either 'SVM' or 'Ensemble' for a machine learning based classification matching or
'score' which is similar to Gramps score-based matching. Soundex is only used in 'score'-matching.
  * 'score' is the fastest but has least accuracy
  * 'SVM' is slower but has better accuracy
  * 'Ensemble' is the slowest algoritm but also the method with best accuracy

**Match Threshold** just selects which matches make it into the list of **Matches**

Press **Match**

If **Automerge** is pressed all matched pairs with a rating above the selected **Automerge rating cutoff** will be merged.

Select a matched pair. If you press **Merge** a Gramps normal PersonMerge will be started.

The **NOT Match** button will simply remove the selected matched pair from the list.

## Compare potential match
Press **Compare** to see the two family-trees (colored blue and brown) for the matched persons in
the selected pair (colored green). Dashed lines connect matched persons, color indicate rating
(from green=1.0 via yellow to red=0.5).

![Graphical compare of match](/TreemergeCompare.png)

Clicking on a person in the graph will set the active person which
can be usefull if you are using a chart like GraphView and want to inspect the families in more detail.

If you press **Merge** a Gramps normal PersonMerge will be started.

When persons are merged an effort will be done to merge compatible events.
